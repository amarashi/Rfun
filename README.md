# Spiral in Shiny
I was bored and I was making this simple beautiful origami spiral![origami spiral](https://github.com/amarashi/sprial_origami/photo_2019-03-12_10-30-47.jpg "Spiral") 
Then I go curious to find out how the same pattern could be crearted mathematically and tried to code it. 
The result can be found [here](https://amirapps.shinyapps.io/spiral/).
