# Spiral in Shiny
I was bored and I was making this simple beautiful origami spiral![origami spiral](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Spiral") 
Then I go curious to find out how the same pattern could be crearted mathematically and tried to code it. 
The result can be found [here](https://amirapps.shinyapps.io/spiral/).
